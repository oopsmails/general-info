### Local development with OpenShift

CodeReady Containers is the quickest way to get started building OpenShift clusters. It is designed to run on a local computer to simplify setup and testing, and emulate the cloud development environment locally with all of the tools needed to develop container-based applications. 

Whatever your programming language, CRC will host your application. CodeReady Containers brings a minimal, preconfigured OpenShift 4.1 (or newer) cluster to your local PC without the need for a server-based infrastructure.

With CodeReady Containers (CRC), you can create microservices, build them into images, and run them in Kubernetes-hosted containers, right on your laptop or desktop running Linux, macOS, or Windows 10. 

CodeReady Containers is designed for local development and testing on an OpenShift 4 cluster. For running an OpenShift 3 cluster locally, see Red Hat Container Development Kit (CDK).
