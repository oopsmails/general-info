## Create VM MacOS in Virtual Box

### Using this instruction

#### Disable Gatekeeper

1. Be sure to exit System Preferences on your Mac.
2. Open a Terminal
3. Enter the command sudo spctl --master-disable.

Source: How to open apps from unidentified developers on Mac in macOS Catalina

#### Check Gatekeeper is disabled
1. Click on System Preferences on your Mac Dock.
2. Choose Security & Privacy.
3. Look at Allow apps download from:, it should be set to Anywhere. If it is, you are done.
4. If not, click the lock icon at the bottom left of the screen.
5. Choose the Anywhere option under Allow apps downloaded from. Prior to making the change, this option wasn't available.
6. Click the unlocked lock again to keep the change.

#### Disable SIP (System Integrity Protection)

1. Restart your computer in Recovery mode.
2. Launch *Terminal* from the *Utilities* menu. **Note**: from the menu above, not in the popup win.
3. Run the command `csrutil disable` .
4. Restart your computer.

I tried pressing F12, F8 and even ESC key in order to configure VirtualBox to boot into the EFI shell but was not able to do so. In the end, this comment from issue 46 had the solution:

1. In your VM's terminal enter the following command to reboot in *recovery* mode:
*sudo nvram recovery-boot-mode=unused && sudo shutdown -r now*
2. Once in recovery mode open a terminal in Utilities->Terminal.
3. Run the commands you want like:
```
csrutil disable
spctl kext-consent add VB5E2TV963
```
(note the last command is explained in steps below)

4. Enter the following command to exit recovery mode:
*nvram -d recovery-boot-mode && shutdown -r now*
5. And you'll get back into normal macOS.

#### Check SIP is disabled
You can verify that SIP is disabled with the command:
`csrutil status`

which should display:
*System Integrity Protection status: disabled..*

#### Allow Oracle identifier for kext

1. Restart your computer in Recovery mode. Refer to previous section to know how to do this.
2. Launch Terminal from the Utilities menu.
3. Run the command spctl kext-consent add VB5E2TV963 .
4. Restart your computer.

VB5E2TV963 is the code for oracle.

In your VM's terminal enter the following commands:

sudo chmod 775 /System/Library/Extensions/
```
