# Ubuntu Time Shift to Backup and Restore

## Install

sudo apt install timeshift

## Backup

Open timeshift

Select RSYNC and hit the Next button

Select backup destination. timeshift will search your system for available file-system partition and provide you with an option to where to create backup file.

Select how often you wish to perform the system backup and how many backup snapshots you wish to retrain before the first backup is overwritten.

As the screenshot indicates the home directories are excluded by default. Depending on you work environment select whether you wish to include home directories into the backup.

This will conclude your initial backup schedule setup. Hit the Finish button.

The backup has not been created yet. You can either wait until the timeshift automatically triggers the backup or simply hit the Create button to perform the previously predefined backup now.


Wait for the backup to complete.


## Restore

At this point we will restore the system from the previously created system backup snapshot. Select a backup snapshot from which you wish to restore and click on the Restore button.


Timeshift give you an option on how to restore from your backup. Unless you know what you are doing simply hit the Next button to go with the default.


The Timeshit will provide you with a list of changes it will take to restore from the backup just to make sure no data is lost in the process.


Once you hit the Next button the system will be restored and restarted. All done.
