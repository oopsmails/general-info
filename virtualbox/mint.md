### Enable snapd

- Snap is available for Linux Mint 18.2 (Sonya), Linux Mint 18.3 (Sylvia), Linux Mint 19 (Tara), Linux Mint 19.1 (Tessa) and the latest release, Linux Mint 20 (Ulyana). You can find out which version of Linux Mint youâ€™re running by opening System info from the Preferences menu.

On Linux Mint 20, /etc/apt/preferences.d/nosnap.pref needs to be removed before Snap can be installed. This can be accomplished from the command line:

```
sudo rm /etc/apt/preferences.d/nosnap.pref
sudo apt update
```

- To install snap from the Software Manager application, search for snapd and click Install.

Either restart your machine, or log out and in again, to complete the installation.
