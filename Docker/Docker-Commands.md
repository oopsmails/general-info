1. docker ps — Lists running containers. Some useful flags include: -a / -all for all containers (default shows just running) and —-quiet /-q to list just their ids (useful for when you want to get all the containers).
1. docker pull — Most of your images will be created on top of a base image from the Docker Hub registry. Docker Hub contains many pre-built images that you can pull and try without needing to define and configure your own. To download a particular image, or set of images (i.e., a repository), use docker pull.
1. docker build — The docker build command builds Docker images from a Dockerfile and a “context”. A build’s context is the set of files located in the specified PATH or URL. Use the -t flag to label the image, for example docker build -t my_container . with the . at the end signalling to build using the currently directory.
1. docker run — Run a docker container based on an image, you can follow this on with other commands, such as -it bash to then run bash from within the container. Also see Top 10 options for docker run — a quick reference guide for the CLI command. docker run my_image -it bash
1. docker logs — Use this command to display the logs of a container, you must specify a container and can use flags, such as --follow to follow the output in the logs of using the program. docker logs --follow my_container
1. docker volume ls — This lists the volumes, which are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers.
1. docker rm — Removes one or more containers. docker rm my_container
1. docker rmi — Removes one or more images. docker rmi my_image
1. docker stop — Stops one or more containers. docker stop my_container stops one container, while docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) stops all running containers. A more direct way is to use docker kill my_container, which does not attempt to shut down the process gracefully first.
1. Use them together, for example to clean up all your docker images and containers:
1. kill all running containers with docker kill $(docker ps -q)
1. delete all stopped containers with docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
1. delete all images with docker rmi $(docker images -q)
