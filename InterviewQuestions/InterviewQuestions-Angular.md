### JIT vs. AoT

Webpack configuration for development mode (Just-in-Time compilation) vs. Right after development, at build time, before your app is downloaded in the Browser (AoT)

### How to bundle an Angular app for production?

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37631098/how-to-bundle-an-angular-app-for-production

*2.x, 4.x, 5.x, 6.x, 7.x, 8.x (TypeScript) with Angular CLI*

- OneTime Setup
    - npm install -g @angular/cli
    - ng new projectFolder creates a new application
- Bundling Step
    - ng build --prod (run in command line when directory is projectFolder)

    - flag prod bundle for production (see the Angular documentation for the list of option included with the production flag).

    - Compress using Brotli compression the resources using the following command

    - for i in dist/*; do brotli $i; done

    - bundles are generated by default to projectFolder/dist(/$projectFolder for 6)

- Output
    - Sizes with Angular 8.0.0-rc.2 with CLI 8.0.0-rc.2and option CSS without Angular routing

    - dist/main-[es-version].[hash].js Your application bundled [ ES5 size: 153 KB for new Angular CLI application empty, 37 KB compressed].
    - dist/polyfill-[es-version].[hash].bundle.js the polyfill dependencies (@angular, RxJS...) bundled [ ES5 size: 110 KB for new Angular CLI application empty, 32 KB compressed].
    - dist/index.html entry point of your application.
    - dist/runtime-[es-version].[hash].bundle.js webpack loader
    - dist/style.[hash].bundle.css the style definitions
    - dist/assets resources copied from the Angular CLI assets configuration
- Deployment
You can get a preview of your application using the ng serve --prod command that starts a local HTTP server such that the application with production files is accessible using http://localhost:4200.

*For a production usage, you have to deploy all the files from the dist folder in the HTTP server of your choice.*

- How can you create a decorator in Angular?
There are two ways to register decorators in Angular. These are:

$provide.decorator, and
module.decorator

- What is the difference between Structural and Attribute directives in Angular?
Structural directives are used to alter the DOM layout by removing and adding DOM elements. It is far better in changing the structure of the view. Examples of Structural directives are NgFor and Nglf.

Attribute Directives These are being used as characteristics of elements. For example, a directive such as built-in NgStyle in the template Syntax guide is an attribute directive.

- What are the Core Dependencies of Angular 7?
Core Dependencies

There are two types of core dependencies: RxJS and TypeScript.

RxJS 6.3

RxJS version 6.3 is used by Angular 7. It has no changes in the version from Angular 6

TypeScript 3.1

TypeScript version 3.1 is used by Angular 7. It is the upgrade from the version2.9 of Angular 6.

- What is IVY Renderer? Is it supported by Angular 7?
Angular will be releasing a new kind of rendering pipeline and view engine.

The purpose of angular view engine is to translate the templates and components that we have written into the regular HTML and JavaScript so it is easy for the browser to read it comfortably. Ivy is believed to be splendid for the Angular Renderer.

Yes, it is supported by Angular 7.

- How to generate a class in Angular 7 using CLI?
Create a class using below code:

ng generate class <name> [options]

ng g class <name> [options]

Where name refers the name of a class.

Options refer to the project name, spec value in Boolean or type of a file

- Explain Bazel?


Bazel is a test tool just like the Make, Maven and Gradle and it is an open-source build. Bazel utilizes readable and high-level build language. It handles the project in a great number of languages and builds the product for a large number of platforms. Moreover, it supports multiple users and large codebases over several repositories.

- How can you handle events in Angular 7?


There are various methods to handle events in Angular 7. These are:

a. Binding to user input events: You are able to use the Angular event binding to answer to DOM event. User input triggers so many DOM events. It is a very effective method to get the input from the user.

For example,

`<button (click)="onClickMe()">Click me!</button>`

b. Get user input from the event object: DOM carries a cargo of the information that possibly is valuable for the components. Here is an example to show you the keyup event of an input box to obtain the user's input after every stroke

``
src/app/keyup.components.ts (template v.1) 
content_copy 
template: ` 
<input (keyup)="onKey($event)"> 
<p>{{values}} </p>
``


c. Key event filtering: Every keystroke is heard by the (keyup) event handler. The enter keys matter the most as it provides the sign of the user that he has done with the typing. The most efficient method of eliminating the noise is to look after every $event.keyCode and the action is taken only when the enter key is pressed


- How to update Angular 4,5, 6 to Angular 7?

First of all, you need to update the Angular version globally by inserting the latest version via the terminal: sudo npm install -g @angular/cli@latest.

The next step is to upgrade the version locally in your project and need to assure the altering for the new version are displayed in the package.json file ng update @angular/cli

When it is done, upgrade all your dependencies and dev dependencies in package.json

To build Angular applications, Angular-devkit was introduced in Angular 6 that needs the dependency on the CLI projects.
With all of this, you'll also require to upgrade the version for Typescriptnpm install typescript@2.9.2 --save-dev

Then, you need to relocate the configuration of angular-cli.json to angular.json ng update @angular/cli and ng update @angular/core.

Use this command: ng update @angular/material in case of Angular material is used.
The next step is the removal of deprecated RxJS 6 features npm install -g rxjs-tslint rxjs-5-to-6-migrate -p src/tsconfig.app.json

When it is done, uninstall rxjs-compat as it is not required for Angular npm uninstall --save rxjs-compat

Also change import { Observable } from 'rxjs/Observable'; to import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

Finally, you are able to start your Angular 7 application by using ng serve

- Question: How do Observables differ from Promises?
- 
Answer: As soon as a promise is made, the execution takes place. However, this is not the case with observables because they are lazy. This means that nothing happens until a subscription is made. While promises handle a single event, observable is a stream that allows passing of more than one event. A callback is made for each event in an observable.


- Question: Can you give us an overview of Angular architecture?

Answer: You can draw some like this:

- Question: What is AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) Compilation?

Answer: Each Angular app gets compiled internally. The Angular compiler takes in the JS code, compiles it and then produces some JS code. This happens only once per occasion per user. It is known as AOT (Ahead-Of-Time) compilation.

- Question: What is Data Binding? How many ways it can be done?

Answer: In order to connect application data with the DOM (Data Object Model), data binding is used. It happens between the template (HTML) and component (TypeScript). There are 3 ways to achieve data binding:

Event Binding – Enables the application to respond to user input in the target environment

Property Binding – Enables interpolation of values computed from application data into the HTML

Two-way Binding – Changes made in the application state gets automatically reflected in the view and vice-versa. The ngModel directive is used for achieving this type of data binding.

- Question: What is the process called by which TypeScript code is converted into JavaScript code?

Answer: It is called Transpiling. Even though TypeScript is used for writing code in Angular applications, it gets internally transpiled into equivalent JavaScript.

- Question: What is ViewEncapsulation and how many ways are there do to do it in Angular?

Answer: To put simply, ViewEncapsulation determines whether the styles defined in a particular component will affect the entire application or not. Angular supports 3 types of ViewEncapsulation:

Emulated – Styles used in other HTML spread to the component

Native – Styles used in other HTML doesn’t spread to the component

None – Styles defined in a component are visible to all components of the application

- Question 15: What is the sequence of Angular Lifecycle Hooks?

Answer:  OnChange()  – OnInit() –  DoCheck() – AfterContentInit()  – AfterContentChecked() – AfterViewInit()  – AfterViewChecked() – OnDestroy().


- Question 16: If you provide a service in two components‘ “providers” section of @Component decorator, how many
instances of service shall get created?

Answer: 2

- Question 17: What is the main difference between constructor and ngOnInit?

Answer: The constructor is a feature of the class itself, not Angular. The main difference is that Angular will launch ngOnInit after it has finished configuring the component. Meaning, it is a signal through which the @Input() and other banding properties and decorated properties are available in ngOnInit, but are not defined within the constructor by design

- Question 18: What modules should you import in Angular to use `[(ngModel)]` and reactive forms?

Answer: FormsModule and Reactiveforms Module.


- Question 21: What is Transpiling in Angular?

Answer: Transpiling means converting the source code of one programming language into another. In Angular, that usually means converting TypeScript into JavaScript. You can write the code for your Angular application in TypeScript (or another language such as Dart) that is then transpiled to JavaScript for the application. This happens internally and automatically.

- Question 22: What is AOT Compilation? 

Answer: AOT refers to Ahead-of-time compilation. In Angular, it means that the code you write for your application is compiled at build time before the application is run in a browser.  It‘s an alternative to Just-in-time compilation, where code is compiled just before it is run in the browser. AOT compilation can lead to better application performance.

- Question 24: How many Change Detectors can there be in the whole application?

Answer: Each component has its own ChangeDetector. All Change Detectors are inherited from AbstractChangeDetector

- Question 25: What change detection strategies do you know?

Answer: There are two strategies – Default and OnPush. If all components use the default strategy, Zone checks the entire tree regardless of where the change occurred. To inform Angular that we will comply with the performance improvement conditions, we need to use the onpush change detection strategy. This will tell Angular that our component depends only on the input and any object that is passed to it should be considered immutable. This is all built on the Principle of the mile automaton, where the current state depends only on the input values.

- Question 26: What is Change Detection, how does Change Detection Mechanism work?

Answer: Change Detection is the process of synchronizing a model with a view. In Angular, the flow of information is unidirectional, even when using the ng Model to implement two-way binding, which is syntactic sugar on top of a unidirectional flow.

Change Detection Mechanism-moves only forward and never looks back, starting from the root (root) component to the last. This is the meaning of one-way data flow. The architecture of an Angular application is very simple — the tree of components. Each component points to a child, but the child does not point to a parent. One-way flow eliminates the need for a $digest loop.

- Question 27: How do you update the view if your data model is updated outside the ‘Zone’?

Answer:

    - Using the ApplicationRef.prototype.tick method, which will run change detection on the entire component tree.
    - Using NgZone.prototype.run method, which will also run change detection on the entire tree. The run method under the hood itself calls tick, and the parameter takes the function you want to perform before tick.
    - Using the ChangeDetectorRef.prototype.detectChanges method, which will launch change detection on the current component and its children.

- Question 28: Why do we need lazy loading of modules and how is it implemented?

Answer: Lazy loading of modules is needed to break the code into pieces. When downloading the app in the browser, it doesn’t load all of the application code. During the transition to the route with lazy loading, the module has to load the code into a browser.

Exemple for using lazy loading modules:

`{ path: ‘example’, loadChildren: ‘./example/example.module#ExampleModule’, component: PublicComponent },`

- Question 29: What are Core and Shared modules for?

Answer: A Shared module serves as a generic module for all modules, components, directives, pipes, etc., which are not required to be in a single copy for the application but need to be imported into many different modules.

A Core module is a place to store services that you need to have in the form of singleton for the entire application (for example, a user authorization service with data storage about it).

- Question 30: What are some points to consider when optimizing an Angular 6 application for performance?
Requirement: Application performance optimization

Answer: There are many ways, some ideas include:

AOT compilation, bundling and uglifying the application, tree shaking, lazy loading, separating dependencies and devDependencies, Using OnPush and TrackBy, removing unnecessary 3rd party libraries and import statements, avoid computing values within the template,

- Question 31: What are some important practices to secure an Angular application?
Requirement: Designing for security

Answer: Some basic guidelines include:

    - Check that all requests come from within your own web app and not external websites
    - Sanitize all input data
    - Use Angular template instead of DOM APIs
    - Content Security Policies
    - Validate all data with server-side code
    - Use an offline template compiler
    - Avoid including external URLs in your application
    - Make JSON responses non-executable
    - Keep all libraries and frameworks up-to-date

- Question 32: What‘s the difference between unit testing and end-to-end testing? What are some testing tools you
would use for an Angular application?
Requirement: End-to-end and unit testing

Answer: Unit testing is a technique to test that isolated segments of code are functioning properly. End-to-end testing involves checking that entire sets of components to make sure they are working together properly and that the application is working as you would expect. End-to-end tests often simulate user interactions to test that an app is functioning as it should. Jasmine and Karma are all great testing tools.

- Question 33: Describe a time you fixed a bug/error in an application. How did you approach the problem? What
debugging tools did you use? What did you learn from this experience?
Requirement: Debugging, Breaking down a problem into parts

Answer: In the candidate‘s response you should look out for things like:

    - A measured, scientific approach
    - Breaking down the problem into parts
    - Finding out how to reproduce the error
    - Expressing and then testing assumptions
    - Looking at stack traces
    - Getting someone else to help/take a look
    - Searching the internet for others that have had the same problem
    - Writing tests to check if the bug returns
    - Checking the rest of the code for similar errors
    - Turn problems into learning experiences
