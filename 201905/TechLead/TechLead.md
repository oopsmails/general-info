
- The world will no longer be binary
- You don't need to have all the answers: team as backup
- Your role is not to be liked by everyone
- You are not alone: may talk to other tech lead, tech console, build support network
- Non-technical areas are as important
- People are complex: new graduate, more instructions ... but not seniors
- You can't do everything yourself: use the Situational Leadership Model
- There are many ways to be a leader: 
    - coach: not telling answers directly but asking question to lead them
    - shepherd: they have the skill but help alone the path or motivation
    - shaman: to show new members why we are here, how come these things like this
    - champion: protect team from being interrupted all the time ...
- You have a secret power: be able to say NO, i.e, maybe my team doesn't have time to do this now, or focus on important things.
- Your role gives you greater impact: make the team more productive
