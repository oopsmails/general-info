I am using mssql studio, when exporting my query result, I want include column names as headers, instead of data only, is that possible?
Including Column Headers When Exporting Query Results in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
Yes, you can definitely include column names as headers when exporting query results from SSMS. Here are the methods to do this:

Method 1: Export to CSV/Excel with Headers
Run your query in SSMS

Right-click on the results grid

Select "Save Results As..."

Choose your file format (CSV or Excel)

In the save dialog, check the option "Include column headers when copying or saving results" (this is checked by default in most SSMS versions)

Method 2: Using the Results to Text Option
Before executing your query, go to Query > Results To > Results to Text (or press Ctrl+T)

Run your query

Right-click the results and select "Save Results As..."

The text file will include headers by default

Method 3: Using the Export Wizard
Right-click your database in Object Explorer

Select Tasks > Export Data...

Follow the wizard steps

When you reach the "Specify Table Copy or Query" step, choose "Write a query"

Enter your query

Continue through the wizard and you'll have options to include headers

Note:
In newer versions of SSMS (17.9+), column headers are included by default when saving results

If you're using "Results to Grid" (Ctrl+D), the "Save Results As" option will include headers by default

If you're not seeing headers when you expect to, check your SSMS version and update if necessary, as older versions had different default behaviors.

when data in one column is with very big size, then query result of it could get truncated .... so, if I don't have file system access of a db server, in ms sql studio, is there a way I could get the whole data, i.e, without being truncated?
Handling Truncated Data in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
When working with large text data (like VARCHAR(MAX), NVARCHAR(MAX), or XML columns) in SSMS, the results are often truncated in the grid view. Here are several ways to retrieve the complete data without truncation:

Method 1: Change Results to Text
Before executing your query: Query > Results To > Results to Text (or Ctrl+T)

Set the maximum characters displayed:

Go to Tools > Options

Navigate to Query Results > SQL Server > Results to Text

Set "Maximum number of characters displayed in each column" to 8192 (max) or your desired value

Run your query

Method 2: Use CAST/SUBSTRING in Your Query
sql
-- View first 8000 characters
SELECT SUBSTRING(largeColumn, 1, 8000) AS partialData
FROM yourTable

-- Or view in chunks
SELECT 
    SUBSTRING(largeColumn, 1, 4000) AS part1,
    SUBSTRING(largeColumn, 4001, 4000) AS part2
FROM yourTable
Method 3: Use the XML Trick
sql
-- This forces SSMS to show the full content
SELECT (SELECT largeColumn AS [*] FOR XML PATH('')) AS fullData
FROM yourTable
Method 4: Increase SSMS Grid Display Limit
Go to Tools > Options

Navigate to Text Editor > XML > Miscellaneous

Change "Maximum characters retrieved" to a higher value (default is 2MB)

Method 5: Use Data Length to Identify Truncated Data
sql
-- Find which rows might be truncated
SELECT DATALENGTH(largeColumn) AS dataLength
FROM yourTable
Method 6: Export to File Without Truncation
Right-click the results grid

Select "Save Results As..."

Choose CSV format - this typically preserves full content

Method 7: Use OPENROWSET for Very Large Data
sql
-- For extremely large content
SELECT BulkColumn
FROM OPENROWSET(BULK 'C:\temp\yourfile.txt', SINGLE_BLOB) AS x
Remember that even with these methods, extremely large data (several MB) might still be challenging to view directly in SSMS. For such cases, consider writing the data to a file using BCP or other export methods.

how to query a largeColumn length?
Checking the Length of Large Columns in SQL Server
To query the length of large columns (like VARCHAR(MAX), NVARCHAR(MAX), VARBINARY(MAX), TEXT, NTEXT, or IMAGE) in SQL Server, you have several options:

Basic Length Functions
sql
-- For character data (returns number of characters)
SELECT 
    LEN(largeColumn) AS character_count,
    DATALENGTH(largeColumn) AS byte_count
FROM yourTable;

-- For NVARCHAR/NCHAR/NTEXT (Unicode) data:
-- LEN() = character count
-- DATALENGTH() = bytes used (2 bytes per character)
Checking for Truncation Risk
sql
-- Identify rows that might be truncated in SSMS (typically > 8,000 chars)
SELECT 
    id,
    LEN(largeColumn) AS char_length,
    CASE 
        WHEN LEN(largeColumn) > 8000 THEN 'WARNING: May be truncated in SSMS'
        ELSE 'OK'
    END AS truncation_warning
FROM yourTable
ORDER BY char_length DESC;
Handling Specific Data Types
sql
-- For TEXT/NTEXT (deprecated types):
SELECT 
    DATALENGTH(largeTextColumn) AS byte_count,
    DATALENGTH(largeTextColumn)/2 AS approx_char_count  -- For NTEXT
FROM yourTable;

-- For VARBINARY(MAX) or IMAGE data:
SELECT 
    DATALENGTH(binaryData) AS byte_count
FROM yourTable;
Finding Maximum Length in a Table
sql
-- Find the maximum length of data in your column
SELECT MAX(LEN(largeColumn)) AS max_char_length,
       MAX(DATALENGTH(largeColumn)) AS max_byte_size
FROM yourTable;
Practical Example
sql
-- Comprehensive column analysis
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
    SUM(CASE WHEN largeColumn IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_count,
    MIN(LEN(largeColumn)) AS min_length,
    MAX(LEN(largeColumn)) AS max_length,
    AVG(LEN(largeColumn)) AS avg_length,
    SUM(CASE WHEN LEN(largeColumn) > 8000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS rows_over_8000_chars
FROM yourTable;
Remember:

LEN() returns the number of characters (excluding trailing spaces)

DATALENGTH() returns the number of bytes used

For Unicode data (NVARCHAR, NTEXT), each character uses 2 bytes

SSMS typically truncates display at 8,000 characters in grid mode

ok, let's go further with Method 2: Use CAST/SUBSTRING in Your Query, I want a query first grep the length of a cell with large date, then calculates how many parts I need and then run something like view in chunks ...
Advanced Chunked Data Extraction Based on Length
Here's a comprehensive solution that:

First analyzes your data length

Calculates the required chunks

Then extracts the data in manageable portions

Step 1: Create a Function to Calculate Chunks (Optional but Helpful)
sql
CREATE FUNCTION dbo.GetDataChunks(@data NVARCHAR(MAX), @chunkSize INT = 4000)
RETURNS TABLE
AS
RETURN
(
    WITH Numbers AS (
        SELECT 1 AS chunkNum
        UNION ALL
        SELECT chunkNum + 1 FROM Numbers WHERE chunkNum < CEILING(LEN(@data)*1.0/@chunkSize)
    )
    SELECT 
        chunkNum,
        SUBSTRING(@data, (chunkNum-1)*@chunkSize + 1, @chunkSize) AS chunkData,
        (chunkNum-1)*@chunkSize + 1 AS startPos,
        CASE 
            WHEN chunkNum*@chunkSize > LEN(@data) THEN LEN(@data)
            ELSE chunkNum*@chunkSize 
        END AS endPos
    FROM Numbers
    WHERE (chunkNum-1)*@chunkSize + 1 <= LEN(@data)
)
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 10000);
Step 2: Analyze Your Data Structure
sql
-- First analyze your table to understand data lengths
SELECT 
    id, -- or your primary key
    LEN(largeColumn) AS totalLength,
    CEILING(LEN(largeColumn)*1.0/4000) AS chunksNeeded
FROM yourTable
WHERE LEN(largeColumn) > 4000 -- Only show rows that need chunking
ORDER BY LEN(largeColumn) DESC;
Step 3: Extract Data in Chunks with Context
sql
-- For a specific record (replace 123 with your ID)
DECLARE @id INT = 123;
DECLARE @chunkSize INT = 4000; -- Adjust as needed

WITH DataInfo AS (
    SELECT 
        largeColumn,
        LEN(largeColumn) AS totalLength,
        CEILING(LEN(largeColumn)*1.0/@chunkSize) AS totalChunks
    FROM yourTable
    WHERE id = @id
)
SELECT 
    d.id,
    c.chunkNum,
    c.totalChunks,
    c.startPos,
    c.endPos,
    c.chunkData,
    CASE 
        WHEN c.chunkNum = 1 THEN 'FIRST CHUNK' 
        WHEN c.chunkNum = c.totalChunks THEN 'LAST CHUNK'
        ELSE 'MIDDLE CHUNK'
    END AS chunkPosition
FROM yourTable d
CROSS APPLY (
    SELECT 
        chunkNum,
        totalChunks,
        startPos,
        endPos,
        chunkData
    FROM DataInfo
    CROSS APPLY dbo.GetDataChunks(largeColumn, @chunkSize)
) c
WHERE d.id = @id
ORDER BY c.chunkNum;
Step 4: For Batch Processing All Large Records
sql
-- Process all large records in the table
DECLARE @chunkSize INT = 4000;

WITH LargeRecords AS (
    SELECT 
        id,
        largeColumn,
        LEN(largeColumn) AS totalLength,
        CEILING(LEN(largeColumn)*1.0/@chunkSize) AS totalChunks
    FROM yourTable
    WHERE LEN(largeColumn) > @chunkSize
)
SELECT 
    lr.id,
    c.chunkNum,
    lr.totalChunks,
    c.startPos,
    c.endPos,
    c.chunkData,
    lr.totalLength,
    CONCAT('Chunk ', c.chunkNum, ' of ', lr.totalChunks, 
           ' (Bytes ', c.startPos, '-', c.endPos, ')') AS chunkDescription
FROM LargeRecords lr
CROSS APPLY dbo.GetDataChunks(lr.largeColumn, @chunkSize) c
ORDER BY lr.id, c.chunkNum;
Alternative Without Function (Direct Query)
sql
-- For a specific record without using the function
DECLARE @id INT = 123;
DECLARE @chunkSize INT = 4000;

WITH LengthInfo AS (
    SELECT 
        id,
        largeColumn,
        LEN(largeColumn) AS totalLength,
        CEILING(LEN(largeColumn)*1.0/@chunkSize) AS totalChunks
    FROM yourTable
    WHERE id = @id
),
ChunkNumbers AS (
    SELECT TOP (SELECT totalChunks FROM LengthInfo)
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) AS chunkNum
    FROM sys.objects a
    CROSS JOIN sys.objects b  -- Just to generate enough numbers
)
SELECT 
    li.id,
    cn.chunkNum,
    li.totalChunks,
    (cn.chunkNum-1)*@chunkSize + 1 AS startPos,
    CASE 
        WHEN cn.chunkNum*@chunkSize > li.totalLength THEN li.totalLength
        ELSE cn.chunkNum*@chunkSize 
    END AS endPos,
    SUBSTRING(li.largeColumn, (cn.chunkNum-1)*@chunkSize + 1, @chunkSize) AS chunkData
FROM LengthInfo li
CROSS JOIN ChunkNumbers cn
WHERE (cn.chunkNum-1)*@chunkSize + 1 <= li.totalLength
ORDER BY cn.chunkNum;
Notes:
Adjust @chunkSize based on your needs (4000 is safe for NVARCHAR)

For VARCHAR data, you can use larger chunks (up to 8000)

The function approach is cleaner for repeated use

Add WHERE clauses to filter specific records as needed

For extremely large data (>MBs), consider exporting to file instead

thanks but no, let's simplify this, only for one row at a time is fine .... I can select one row with ID, then only one column of this row is with large data .... I want to show it as chunks ....
Simplified Chunked Data Viewer for a Single Row
Here's a straightforward solution to view large column data in chunks for one specific row at a time:

Basic Chunking Query (Single Row)
sql
DECLARE @id INT = 123;  -- Replace with your actual row ID
DECLARE @chunkSize INT = 4000; -- Characters per chunk (adjust as needed)

-- First get the total length
DECLARE @totalLength INT;
SELECT @totalLength = LEN(largeColumn)
FROM YourTable
WHERE id = @id;

-- Calculate number of chunks needed
DECLARE @chunkCount INT = CEILING(@totalLength * 1.0 / @chunkSize);

-- Display metadata first
SELECT 
    @id AS row_id,
    @totalLength AS total_characters,
    @chunkCount AS total_chunks,
    @chunkSize AS characters_per_chunk;

-- Now display the actual data chunks
WITH chunks AS (
    SELECT 1 AS chunk_num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT chunk_num + 1 FROM chunks WHERE chunk_num < @chunkCount
)
SELECT 
    chunk_num AS chunk_number,
    (chunk_num - 1) * @chunkSize + 1 AS start_position,
    CASE 
        WHEN chunk_num * @chunkSize > @totalLength THEN @totalLength
        ELSE chunk_num * @chunkSize
    END AS end_position,
    SUBSTRING(
        (SELECT largeColumn FROM YourTable WHERE id = @id),
        (chunk_num - 1) * @chunkSize + 1,
        @chunkSize
    ) AS data_chunk
FROM chunks
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 100); -- Increase if you expect more than 100 chunks
Even Simpler Version (Without Recursive CTE)
sql
DECLARE @id INT = 123;  -- Your row ID
DECLARE @chunkSize INT = 4000; -- Characters per chunk

-- Get the data once
DECLARE @largeData NVARCHAR(MAX);
SELECT @largeData = largeColumn FROM YourTable WHERE id = @id;

-- Display chunks using a numbers table approach
SELECT 
    n AS chunk_number,
    ((n - 1) * @chunkSize + 1) AS start_position,
    CASE 
        WHEN n * @chunkSize > LEN(@largeData) THEN LEN(@largeData)
        ELSE n * @chunkSize
    END AS end_position,
    SUBSTRING(@largeData, (n - 1) * @chunkSize + 1, @chunkSize) AS data_chunk
FROM (
    SELECT TOP (CEILING(LEN(@largeData) * 1.0 / @chunkSize))
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) AS n
    FROM sys.objects -- Any system table with enough rows
) AS numbers;
Usage Instructions:
Replace @id = 123 with your actual row ID

Replace YourTable with your actual table name

Replace largeColumn with your actual column name

Adjust @chunkSize as needed (4000 works well for NVARCHAR)

Run the query to see all chunks for that specific row

Key Features:
Shows chunk numbering (1, 2, 3...)

Displays exact character positions for each chunk

Handles the last chunk which might be smaller

Works for both VARCHAR and NVARCHAR data

Simple to adapt for different chunk sizes
