# Angular General Infos

## Generals

### angular alias import not working

- angular alias, *@app*, import
- vs code not recognizing angular aliases
- seems not supported well in augular 14 and vs code as of 20221107.


## Error:

### @angular/platform-browser-dynamic@"^14.0.4" from the root project

Sometimes, if the project was build by using yarn before, then there is yarn.lock, similarly, if npm, then there is package-lock.json. 
So, we may need to delete those files and do *npm i* again ...
