# Angular General Infos

## Error:

### @angular/platform-browser-dynamic@"^14.0.4" from the root project

Sometimes, if the project was build by using yarn before, then there is yarn.lock, similarly, if npm, then there is package-lock.json. 
So, we may need to delete those files and do *npm i* again ...
